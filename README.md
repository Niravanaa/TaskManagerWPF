# TaskManagerWPF

TaskManagerWPF is a feature-rich task management application built with Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and C#. I want to design to develop my WPF and C# skills by following a roadmap that includes various stages of functionality enhancements.

## Roadmap

### 1. Basic Task List
   - Create a WPF application that allows users to add, edit, delete, and list tasks using a ListBox or ListView.

### 2. Task Properties
   - Enhance the application by enabling users to specify task properties like title, description, due date, and priority level for each task.

### 3. Save and Load
   - Implement functionality to save and load tasks to/from a file (e.g., XML, JSON, or a database) to learn about file I/O and data storage concepts.

### 4. Task Categories
   - Add the ability to categorize tasks. Users can create categories (e.g., Work, Personal, Shopping) and assign tasks to them, teaching you about data structures for managing categories.

### 5. Task Filtering and Sorting
   - Implement filters and sorting options, allowing users to view tasks by category, priority, due date, and more. This stage emphasizes data manipulation and UI updates.

### 6. User Authentication (Optional)
   - For an extra challenge, explore adding user authentication to enable multiple users to maintain their task lists. This involves user management and security concepts.

### 7. Task Notifications
   - Implement task notifications or reminders to alert users when a task's due date is approaching or has passed. This introduces timers and event handling.

### 8. UI/UX Enhancements
   - Continuously improve the user interface and user experience by delving into WPF styling, templates, and animations.

### 9. Data Validation
   - Implement data validation to ensure users provide valid inputs for tasks, such as valid dates and non-empty titles.

### 10. Data Backup and Restore (Optional)
   - Add functionality to backup and restore task data, allowing users to keep their data safe.

### 11. Reports and Statistics (Optional)
   - Explore data analysis by adding features to generate task-related reports and statistics.

### 12. Cloud Sync (Advanced)
   - For advanced learners, integrate cloud storage and synchronization features to enable users to access their tasks from multiple devices.

## Getting Started

To try out TaskManagerWPF, clone this repository and open it in Visual Studio. As time goes on, I will be attempting to complete the above roadmap in a consistent manner.

Feel free to customize and expand TaskManagerWPF! Happy coding!
